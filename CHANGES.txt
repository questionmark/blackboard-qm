Version 9.1.3
-------------

This is the first release specific to Blackboard Learn 9.1.

This release addresses an important security issue; users are encouraged to try this
release out now and report back problems ASAP.

It introduces several important new features.  Content items created by the
connector can now be copied between courses, either individually or
as part of the more general course copy procedure.

Content items created with version 4.3/4.4 of the connector can now
be upgraded for use with this version of the connector.  To make this
easier the course control panel now detects these 'legacy' content
items and provides links to make it easier to upgrade them.

[#216] Manual Synchronization Option for Large Courses

[#361] Limit use of the connector to specified courses

Instructors can now use a content item to create and display a Perception
assessment schedule directly.  These content items are fully compatible with the
adaptive release feature of Blackboard.

The user interface of the connector has been re-organized to split the Control
Panel/CourseTool view (for Instructors) and the main Tool view (for Students).

that can be copied from the instructor's view and pasted into content items.

own schedule if they know the schedule name.  Permission to take the assessment
is of course controlled by the schedule settings and is not affected.

Added a three way option to support percentage, point scores or no gradebook
entry at all.  By default, percentage is chosen.

Note that a schedule may be retrospectively converted to percentage format by
changing the "Points Possible" in the grade centre to 100.  Existing scores are
NOT converted so do not change this setting unless it is set to 0, indicating
that no results have been received yet.
