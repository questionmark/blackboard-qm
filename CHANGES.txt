Version 9.0.32
--------------

This is a significant new release of the connector with a new synchronizer
and a number of improvements to the management of content items.

	This issue has been fixed for content items
[#326] Make Schedule Unavailable
	Added checkbox to enable standard content availability flag to be set
[#321] Save schedule restricted times in Blackboard content item
	Content items now synchronize standard content availability times with schedule
[#209] Use tree-views for Assessment list browsing

[#216] Manual Synchronization Option for Large Courses
[#325] Improve Synchronization
	All new 'just-in-time' synchronization process should work for all sizes of course
	Course members are now synchronized *individually* when they access the connector

	instructor to force the synchronization in the control panel).  Manual synchronization
	is still possible if desired.
[#361] Limit use of the connector to specified courses
	Group synchronization can now optionally be disabled allowing Perception-side control
	of which courses are synchronized if desired.

own schedule if they know the schedule name.  Permission to take the assessment
is of course controlled by the schedule settings and is not affected.

Added a three way option to support percentage, point scores or no gradebook
entry at all.  By default, percentage is chosen.

Note that a schedule may be retrospectively converted to percentage format by

NOT converted so do not change this setting unless it is set to 0, indicating
that no results have been received yet.
