[#233] Add support for adding an assessment using a content handler
[#212] Schedules used in combination with adaptive release in Blackboard

Instructors can now use a content item to create and display a Perception
assessment schedule directly.  These content items are fully compatible with the
adaptive release feature of Blackboard.

Instructors can now hide the list of schedules from the student view, the
schedules can be accessed by the student using a schedule specific URL
that can be copied from the instructor's view and pasted into content items.

Note that schedules are NOT securely hidden, determined students can view their
own schedule if they know the schedule name.  Permission to take the assessment
is of course controlled by the schedule settings and is not affected.

[#219] Reporting of percentage scores

Added a three way option to support percentage, point scores or no gradebook
entry at all.  By default, percentage is chosen.

Note that a schedule may be retrospectively converted to percentage format by
changing the "Points Possible" in the grade centre to 100.  Existing scores are
NOT converted so do not change this setting unless it is set to 0, indicating
that no results have been received yet.


[#208] Moved results view to a separate page

[#211] Partial fix: IDs removed from administrator view

[#210] Removed IDs from student view of schedules
