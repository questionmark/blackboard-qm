Instructors can now use a content item to create and display a Perception

adaptive release feature of Blackboard.

The user interface of the connector has been re-organized to split the Control
Panel/CourseTool view (for Instructors) and the main Tool view (for Students).

[#232] Re-organized the code to improve usability in Eclipse


Version 9.0.8
-------------

Includes fixes for:

[#212] Compatibility with adaptive release

Instructors can now hide the list of schedules from the student view, the
schedules can still be accessed by the student using a schedule specific URL
that can be copied from the instructor's view and pasted into content items.

Note that schedules are NOT securely hidden, determined students can view their
own schedule if they know the schedule name.  Permission to take the assessment
is of course controlled by the schedule settings and is not affected.

[#219] Reporting of percentage scores

Added a three way option to support percentage, point scores or no gradebook
entry at all.  By default, percentage is chosen.

Note that a schedule may be retrospectively converted to percentage format by
changing the "Points Possible" in the grade centre to 100.  Existing scores are
NOT converted so do not change this setting unless it is set to 0, indicating
that no results have been received yet.

[#208] Moved results view to a separate page
