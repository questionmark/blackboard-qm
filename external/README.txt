All of the Jars in this directory must be taken straight from Blackboard 9. They
are required when building the project .war file, but are not included in the
.war file itself.  For licensing reasons they must not be distributed with the
connector source code.

The list of required libraries is:

axis.jar
bb-cms-admin.jar
bb-platform.jar
bb-taglibs.jar
commons-discovery-0.4.jar
commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
jaxrpc.jar
saaj.jar
servlet-api.jar
wsdl4j.jar
